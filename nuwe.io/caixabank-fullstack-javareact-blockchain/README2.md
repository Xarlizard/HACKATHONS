## Running Locally ðŸš€

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 or higher
- Maven
- Node.js 16 or higher
- npm/yarn
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd Backend/blockchain
```

2. Build the project with Maven:
```bash
mvn clean install
```

3. Run the Spring Boot application:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
The backend will start on `http://localhost:8080`

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd Frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```
The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000`

### Using Docker (Optional)
1. Build and run the containers:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Accessing the Application
1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Register a new account or use the following demo credentials:
   - Username: demo
   - Password: demo123

### Default Ports
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend: `http://localhost:8080`
- Database: `http://localhost:5432` (if using PostgreSQL)

### Troubleshooting
- If you encounter CORS issues, ensure both frontend and backend are running
- Check if ports 3000 and 8080 are available
- For database connection issues, verify PostgreSQL is running and credentials are correct
